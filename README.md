# Fibre fantasies frontend

This project is a full-stack social media platform centered around one of my hobbies: crochet and knitting. It allows users to search for patterns (provided by the Ravelry API), save them to a list, and share posts showcasing their own work. Users can follow one another, interact with posts, and discover and organise patterns.

## How it's made

The frontend is built with **React** and **Vite**, which provides fast development builds. Navigation is achieved using **React-Router** and the interface is composed of reusable components that communicate with the backend using RESTful API calls for CRUD operations.

The frontend integrates **ImageKit**, which provides optimised image rendering. Images uploaded by users are returned as ImageKit URLs (from the backend) and are subsequently rendered on the frontend.

Styling is achieved with **CSS modules**, enabling local scopes and therefore greater code maintainability.
